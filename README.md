# Devicesniffer

## Description

Tracks devices that are seen by the Flatiron School Meraki router

## Background

This app was made as a use case for the Meraki router and the applications within.  This application also uses Dashing Rails in order to display the widget data.

## Features

-  Keeps track of unique devices via their mac address as they are seen by the router
-  Will monitor latest traffic in the area.
-  Analyzes each of the mac addresses for their manufacturer and shows the top manufacturers
-  Can track speed of a mac address device traveling between two points

## Usage

Usage is through a dashboard to monitor the tracked data.

## Future

There are some underlying improvements that involve how the dashboard updates its data.  Also, physically moving the access points will improve the speed tracking data.
